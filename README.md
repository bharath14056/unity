🕹️ Project Type: Augmented Reality (AR) Game
📱 Platform: Mobile (Android/iOS) using Unity + AR Foundation
📌 Project Description:
AR Shooting Master is an interactive mobile augmented reality shooting game built with Unity and AR Foundation. The player uses their mobile device as a virtual gun to aim and shoot at AR targets that appear in their real-world environment. The game offers an immersive shooting experience by blending virtual enemies, objects, and visual effects into the real world through the device camera.

🚀 Key Features:
✅ AR Target Spawning: Virtual targets (enemy drones, robots, aliens, or balloons) appear at random positions in the player’s environment.

✅ Gun Control: Tap the screen or use a crosshair to aim and shoot at targets.

✅ Score System: Real-time score updates based on accuracy and number of targets hit.

✅ Timer or Survival Mode: Limited time to hit maximum targets or survive against waves.

✅ Explosion/Hit Effects: Visual and audio feedback when targets are hit.

✅ 3D Gun Model in Camera View: A 3D weapon model is fixed in the foreground, simulating a first-person shooter.

✅ AR Plane Detection: Targets can float or be anchored to AR planes (floors, walls).

✅ Leaderboard (Optional): Local or cloud-based score tracking.

✅ Sound Effects and Background Music.
